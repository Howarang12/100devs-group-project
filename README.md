We tried to recreate a simple commenting system similar to what is found on youtube. 

Functionalities include: 
-allowing users to log in
-logged in users can post, edit, or delete their own comments
-logged in users can reply to and like other users' comments

For keys, create a keys.js file in the config folder and input the info found in ./config/keyFormat.js. This was done in place of using .env

Optimizations in the future:
-allow users to reply to other user replies
