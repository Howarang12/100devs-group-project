We tried to recreate a simple commenting system similar to what is found on youtube. <br />

Functionalities include: <br />
-allowing users to log in <br />
-logged in users can post, edit, or delete their own comments <br />
-logged in users can reply to and like other users' comments<br />

For keys, create a keys.js file in the config folder and input the info found in ./config/keyFormat.js. This was done in place of using .env <br />

Optimizations in the future: <br />
-allow users to reply to other user replies
